Allow authors to easily print a QR code for each page/post.

== Description ==

Adds a 'QR' button next to 'Get Shortlink' on published pages and posts. 

Your authors can click it to print out a QR image and promote what they created. The QR code is created using the 'shortlink'.
The plugin uses the Google Charts API and (as the name applies) is stupid simple to set up and use!

= Options =
There is one optional feature:

In the settings you can add some text that will be appended to the URL on the QR codes. This can be used for tracking purposed. 
For instance, You can set it as: *&medium=qr*. That way, links will look like: *yourdomain.com/?p=195&medium=qr* in your 
analytics. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `stupid-simple-qr` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it. You are done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you create this when there are som many other QR plugins? =

There are a bunch of other QR related plugins. However they are for including QRs in your posts. **This
creates QR images FOR YOUR POSTS!**

My authors needed a simple way to get the QR of the posts they create. This was the solution.

= Does it do X, Y, or Z??? =
No, no and no.

= Who uses QR codes anyway? =
Good question. In my experience, they are rarely used by customers. However, this doesn't mean that your authors aren't
demanding them anyway.

If someone wants to create QR codes: 

1. Ask them to watch "QR Codes Kill Kittens": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzY4v_aOEE by Scott Stratten.
1. What, they still want them? Use this plugin and save yourself the headache.
